Hi, my name is Jen. I live in Fort Worth, Texas.

My hobbies including running and exploring new places with friends.

I recently got engaged and am planning my wedding.

After graduation, I hope to get a job in Texas or Raleigh, NC.

#Programming background

I am on my third of five terms at Oregon State.

My favorite project so far has been my final for Intro to CS II, in which I made
a maze game.
